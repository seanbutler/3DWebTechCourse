## Assignment Description

The client has been impressed by the success of 'Race the Sun' game on mobile phones and steam, hoping to cash in on the interest in similar racing games they have contracted you to make a low cost fast abstract/sci-fi racing game in a similar style.

## Controlled Conditions

The university requires we assess you under controlled conditions, this means we must be sure you have carried out the work. Usually this happens in the presence of examiners, etc. While you have carried out much of the work inside the tutorial, there are plenty of opportunities for you to do work outside the tutorials. In these circumstances we will sit with you for a few minutes and have you demonstrate the game. You will have to show us the code and assets you used. You will have to answer a small number of technical questions about your code and perhaps prove authorship by being able to make minor changes on the fly.


## Deliverables

- The Unity game deployed to your UWE student module homepage.
- A zip file that includes all the js, css and html files necessary also any assets and datafiles.
- Screen shots of key points and features in the game. Clearly labelled and explaining the feature being shown.
