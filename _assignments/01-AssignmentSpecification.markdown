## Controlled Conditions

The university requires we assess you under controlled conditions, this means we must be sure you have carried out the work. Usually this means you carry out the work in the presence of tutors. While you may have carried out some of the work in the tutorial, there are plenty of opportunities for you to do work outside the tutorials. So, we will sit with you for a few minutes and have you demonstrate the game. You will have to show us the code and assets you used. You will have to answer a small number of technical questions about your code and prove understanding and authorship by being able to make minor changes on the fly.
