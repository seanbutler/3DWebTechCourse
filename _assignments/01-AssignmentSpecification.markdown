## Assignment Description

The client has been impressed by the success of 'Race the Sun' game on mobile phones and steam, hoping to cash in on the interest in similar racing games they have contracted you to make a low cost fast abstract/sci-fi racing game in a similar style.

The game should be bug free and run at 30 frames per second or above on the machines in 2Q25 FR (the workshop lab).

## Deliverables

The entire submission should be in a zip archive which unpacks to a directory named for the module code and your student ID number: UFCXXX-30-2_12345678.zip
The archive should contain the following:

__Playable__ A folder/dir containing all the js, css and html files required also any assets, datafiles and scripts necessary to run the game on a local web server like we use in the labs.

__overview.pdf__ A pdf document containing: A URL to the The WebGL/ThreeJS game deployed to the web. Screen shots of key points and features in the game. Clearly labelled and explaining the feature being shown.

__credits.txt__  Where you have used any assets, art, sounds, code from sources which you have not created yourself you must include a clear list including links and licences. Where you have not, include a clear statement to this effect in the credits file.

## Assessment Criteria

You may receive the following percentage marks for populating your deliverables with the necessary technical features. The effectiveness, efficiency, of your feature will be taken into account. So a poor quality, partial, ineffective or slow implementation will receive fewer marks.

Technical Criteria |  Technical Percentage
:---|:---
Game Loop                 | 10%
Environment and Obstacles | 10%
Avatar and Controls       | 10%
Collision                 | 10%
Lighting and Shadows      | 10%
Shaders and FX            | 5%
Menus and HUD             | 5%
__Total__                 | __60%__


In the following criteria marks will be awarded for the thematic qualities of your submission.

Thematic Achievements | Thematic Percentage
:---|:---
Gameplay (Challenging, Compelling Fun, Novelty)      | 15%
Visuals (Beautiful, Interesting and or Cool Looking) | 15%
Extra (Web Page, Sound, Music, Surprise Me)          | 10%
__Total__                                            | __40%__


For Example: There are 15% possible marks for the gameplay. These are in addition to the 10% you might obtain for the technical achievement of getting an avatar with controls. If you game plays particularly well has a good balance of challenge and is compelling you will score more marks here.

For Example: Also there are 15% possible marks for visuals These are in addition to the 10% for lighting and 5% for shaders. Art direction, coherent environmental art, beauty, novelty or otherwise visually interesting etc will gain you marks here.  

## Hints on How to Obtain these Thematic Marks

- Gameplay - Moving Obstacles, Timer, Jumps, Powerups, Collectables, etc, Multiple Levels, etc
- Coherent Artistic Theme & Concept across the game
- Visual Environmental Changes per level
- Visual FX & Music Change with Gameplay Context
- Webpage style attractive and consistent with game art direction

## Controlled Conditions

The university requires we assess you under controlled conditions, this means we must be sure you have carried out the work. Usually this means you carry out the work in the presence of tutors. While you may have carried out some of the work in the tutorial, there are plenty of opportunities for you to do work outside the tutorials.

## Additional Assessment Method

In addition to the digital submission you will be subject to a personal viva. We will sit with you for a few minutes and have you demonstrate the game 1 to 1. You will have to show us the code and assets you used. You will have to answer a small number of technical questions about your code and prove understanding and authorship by being able to make minor changes on request.
