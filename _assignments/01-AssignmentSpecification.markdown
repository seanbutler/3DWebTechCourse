## Assignment Description

The client has been impressed by the success of 'Race the Sun' game on mobile phones and steam, hoping to cash in on the interest in similar racing games they have contracted you to make a low cost fast abstract/sci-fi racing game in a similar style.

The game should be bug free and run at 30 frames per second or above on the machines in 2Q25 FR (the workshop lab).

## Deliverables

  - All the js, css and html files required also any assets, datafiles and scripts and instructions necessary to run the game on a local web server.
  - A pdf document containing:
    - A URL to the The WebGL/ThreeJS game deployed to the web.
    - Screen shots of key points and features in the game. Clearly labelled and explaining the feature being shown.

Where you have used any assets, art, sounds, code from sources which you have not created yourself you must include a credits.txt with a clear list including links and licences.

## Assessment Criteria

You may receive the following percentage marks for populating your deliverables with the necessary technical features.

Technical Criteria |  Technical Percentage
:---|:---

- Coherent Artistic Theme & Concept across the game
- Visual Environmental Changes per level
- Visual FX & Music Change with Gameplay Context

## Controlled Conditions

The university requires we assess you under controlled conditions, this means we must be sure you have carried out the work. Usually this means you carry out the work in the presence of tutors. While you may have carried out some of the work in the tutorial, there are plenty of opportunities for you to do work outside the tutorials. So, we will sit with you for a few minutes and have you demonstrate the game. You will have to show us the code and assets you used. You will have to answer a small number of technical questions about your code and prove understanding and authorship by being able to make minor changes on request.
