<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>MDA  is  a  formal  approach  to  understanding  games  --  one which attempts to bridge the gap between game design and development,  game  criticism,  and  technical  game  research.
We believe this methodology will clarify and strengthen the iterative  processes  of  developers,  scholars  and  researchers alike,  making  it  easier  for  all  parties  to  decompose,  study
and design a broad class of game designs and game.
