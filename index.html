<p>Using Three.js create web pages accessing the features of WebGL including, geometry, materials, cameras, lights, animation.</p>
<p>Accessing various Web technologies via GitHub</p>
<p>Closely couple the 3d simulation with the web page and user interaction</p>
<p>By the end you will be able to create complex realtime 3d simulations which run in a web page.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>I made this, you did not make it.</p>
<p>You can use it, learn it or teach it, but you must attribute me clearly by name "Sean Butler" and link to the url "www.seanbutler.net". I am not responsible for your use or anything else ever.</p>
<p>Lots of other people worked on similar materials and on the libraries I reference. They made those things, not me.</p>
