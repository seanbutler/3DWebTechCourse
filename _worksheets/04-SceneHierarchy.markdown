## Previously on 3DTFTW

- Make a more realistic scene using many atmospheric tools
- Add Fog to the scene
- Add Lights to the scene
- Setup some better materials
- Investigate variations in lighting and for to see how it changes the scene

## Aims and Objectives

Like most sessions we are going to investigate more than one issue.
- Shadows for More Realistic lighting
- A Scene Hierarchy (Objects with Children)

## Introduction

Shadows are self explanatory, we give the renderer some information about the accuracy and extent of the shadows we want then it will calculate them for specific lights.

The scene hierarchy is a little more subtle, all the objects in your scene can be arranged in a parent child structure, a bit like a family tree. This gives us a certain flexibility when we want to do things (more later).

## Step 1 - Shadows

Clone your code from where you got to last time into a new project directory. Perhaps you now have a scene with several floating objects over flat (ish) landscape?
